📊 Tracking Loss Value Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project is a Tracking Loss Value Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI, designed to help businesses monitor and reduce value losses that occur during the flow from sales, delivery, and final goods receipt. 🚚📦

✨ The dashboard provides a clear visual breakdown of three main metrics:

Total Sales

Total Delivery

Total Received

It also highlights the loss percentage and total value lost between:
🔻 Sales → Delivery
🔻 Delivery → Received

📈 A time-series area chart displays trends in total delivery vs total received, allowing users to spot performance fluctuations over time.
🗺️ An interactive map visualizes loss clusters by branch, giving spatial awareness of where the highest discrepancies are occurring.

🍞 A category-based bar chart compares product groups (Dairy, Bakery, Beverage, Snack) by delivery, received, and percentage loss—helping identify which product types are driving the most issues.

📋 At the bottom, a loss detail table shows branch, customer name, product, total sales, loss value, and the specific reason for delivery failure (such as "Customer not available" or "Product out of stock").

🔍 Filters are included to allow users to explore the data by branch or product, enabling a more focused analysis.

💡 This project highlights how Power BI can transform raw data into powerful insights, helping businesses take proactive steps in solving operational inefficiencies and improving accuracy in the supply chain. It’s a valuable tool for professionals in logistics, supply chain, and operations who rely on real-time, data-driven decisions.
