📊 Loss Value Tracking Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project is a Loss Value Tracking Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI, with the goal of helping businesses monitor and minimize value losses during the distribution process—from sales to delivery to final receipt. 🚛📦

✨ The dashboard provides a clear visual breakdown of three core metrics:

Total Sales

Total Delivery

Total Received

It also highlights the loss percentage and value between:
🔻 Sales → Delivery
🔻 Delivery → Received

📈 A time-series chart tracks delivery vs received trends across the timeline, making it easy to spot spikes or anomalies in performance.
🗺️ An interactive map visualizes branch-level loss distribution, helping decision-makers focus on areas with the highest inefficiencies.

📊 On the right panel, a bar chart compares product categories (Dairy, Bakery, Beverage, Snack) with their respective delivery and received values—plus loss percentage. You can clearly see where losses are most frequent by product type.

📋 At the bottom, a detailed table lists each branch, customer, product, total sales, loss value, and the reason for delivery issues (e.g., "Customer not available", "Product out of stock", or "Incorrect address").

🔍 Users can filter the data by Branch or Product, making the dashboard fully interactive and drill-down ready.

💡 This project showcases how Business Intelligence tools like Power BI can turn raw operational data into powerful insights—helping organizations take proactive action and reduce financial leakage. It’s especially valuable for teams in logistics, supply chain, or operations looking to improve performance with data-driven decisions.
